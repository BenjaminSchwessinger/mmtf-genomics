# mmtf-genomics
Methods for mapping genomics data onto 3D protein structure.

A few example Jupyter Notebooks are available for testing and feedback.
* [dbSNPTo3DChain.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sbl-sdsc/mmtf-genomics/blob/master/dbsnp/dbSNPTo3DChain.ipynb) Visualizes the positions of missense mutations mapped from dbSNP to 3D protein structures in the Protein Data Bank. 
* [MutationsInPdb.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sbl-sdsc/mmtf-genomics/blob/master/dbsnp/MutationsInPdb.ipynb) Finds and visualizes existing missense mutations from dbSNP in protein structure from the Protein Data Bank. 

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sbl-sdsc/mmtf-genomics/master) to run life Jupter Notebooks in your web browser without software installation.

Launching the Binder server may take a few minutes. [Binder (beta)](https://mybinder.org/) is an experimental platform for reproducible research (The Binder servers can be slow, may run out of memory, or may not always work).

Then navigate to the dbsnp directory and launch any of the notebooks.
